<p>I am a recent graduate of the Flatiron School's Online Web Developer Program with experience in Ruby on Rails, JavaScript and React.  As a former Technical Project Manager, I have a deep understanding of the agile process and product development lifecycle, along with strong communication, organization and problem-solving skills. I am excited to combine these strengths, along with my new programming abilities, to start my new career as one of the solution-builders.     </p>
